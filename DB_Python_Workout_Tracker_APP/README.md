# SUMMARY

This is a purely pythonic implementation of a work out tracker app. I am currenlty using a local instance of MySQL to pull data from and populate the app.

# FUTURE

I plan on making an HTML, CSS, JS implementation of this same app once I am happy with this one. 

# TECHNOLOGIES/TECHNIQUES USED

MySQL, Python, Tkinter (GUI), and OOP principals
