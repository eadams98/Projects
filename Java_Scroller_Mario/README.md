# SUMMARY

This is a sort of imitation/recreation of Mario/Kirby games. So far I have player movement, enemy movement, collision detection for most things, power ups, pausing and reset all things after death. The map and elements such as blocks and pipes are created from a 2d matrix. At any given time the map can be changed by simply adjusting a matrix value, which will make map creation simple. I got the itch to make something like this from coding pacman as an assignment.

# FUTURE

I plan on adding additional levels once I finish fleshing out the first one. A more impending change is updating the enemy AI/Logic.
